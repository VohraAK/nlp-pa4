    "# Task 1: Function and Tool Calling with Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, you will explore how modern LLMs can interact with external tools and functions to perform real-world tasks beyond simple text generation.  \n",
    "You will learn how to **connect an LLM to APIs, databases, and system functions**, enabling it to perform practical operations such as searching the web, managing tasks, and controlling a simulated household device.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overview: What Is Function Calling in LLMs?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Function calling** allows an LLM to call specific functions or APIs during a conversation based on the user’s request.  \n",
    "Rather than relying only on natural language generation, the model determines *when and how* to invoke a tool, API, or system function to gather data, perform computations, or change system states.\n",
    "\n",
    "This mechanism bridges the gap between **language understanding** and **real-world action**.  \n",
    "It makes the LLM an **active reasoning agent** that can access structured tools or APIs when it detects that such calls are necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Web Search Tools Matter: Tavily Search API\n",
    "\n",
    "For this task, we will use the **Tavily Search API** — a web search API designed specifically for LLM applications.  \n",
    "You can set up Tavily by visiting the official website and generating an API key.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task Scenario: Household Assistant Application\n",
    "\n",
    "You will design a small **Household Assistant Application** where an LLM uses function calling to manage everyday tasks.  \n",
    "The system will include a series of tool functions that the model can invoke based on user prompts.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The LLM will decide which tool to use and automatically format the function call as defined in its configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functions to Implement\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Web Search Function\n",
    "\n",
    "This function will use the **Tavily Search API** to perform web searches when the LLM identifies that external information is needed.  \n",
    "You should configure your Tavily API key and handle the returned search results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. To-Do List\n",
    "\n",
    "Your assistant will maintain a to-do list stored as text embeddings in a vector store (e.g., Chroma).\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll need a tool for adding to a To-Do List, and a tool to query from that To-Do List\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Get Current Time\n",
    "\n",
    "A tool to get the current system time\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Toggle Light On/Off\n",
    "\n",
    "This function simulates turning a light on or off in your home. The current state of the light needs to be stored. \n",
    "You also need two tools for this. One to toggle it on (if it's off) or off (if it's on), and the other to check and return the current state."
